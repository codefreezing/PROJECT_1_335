Project 1 - Cella Ant 15
Team: SAKURA
Members: Phuong Nguyen & Phuc Dang

Intro: This project is based on the ideal of Turk & Propp's Ants in which an ant represented by a white triangle moves from cell to cell on a 41 x 41 black grid. The ant starts moving from the center of the grid. The ant will have more than 1000 moves. The ant follows a rule on how it should move. 
When the ant meets a black or yellow cell, its direction will rotate 90 degrees to the right.
When the ant meets a red or blue cell, it will change direction to the left. 
After leaving a black cell, the black cell will turn to red, then the red will turn into yellow, then blue, and then green. 
To manipulate each move of the ant, we use an array to store all the moves.
